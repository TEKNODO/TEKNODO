            <h2>UI DESIGN</h2>
              <p>
                 A UI (User Interface) deals with the application's graphical layout, which includes buttons, screen layout, animations, transitions, micro-interactions, and so on. In short, UI is all about how things look.
               </p>
            <h2>Ux DESIGN</h2>
               <p>
                  UX (User Experience) design deals with how users interact with the system. Logical navigation and how smooth and intuitive the experience is all fall under UX design. In short, this type of design helps users have a positive experience.

                Especially important in user experience (UX) design, design thinking helps to address changes in users’ environments and behaviors that may not be immediately apparent. This is good news for both users and the company bottom line, as designers are continuously researching, testing, and improving products.
                </h5><br>
                 <h5 class="text-secondary text-center"style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;align-self: center;letter-spacing: 2px;">UX designers put themselves in the user’s shoes, becoming empathetic to their desires and grievances. They also follow a set of hands-on steps (often used interchangeably with phases and stages). Ultimately, using design thinking allows UX teams to do better research, prototyping, and usability testing to address human needs in the modern age.

                    <li>Empathize</li>
                    <li>Define</li>
                    <li>Ideation</li>
                    <li>Prototype</li>
                    <li>Test</li> </h4>
                  </ol>
              </div>
         <div>
          <h1>1.Empathize</h1>
          <p>
            The first step isn’t to look at the market, the features your product will have or anything related to the product itself. The first thing you want to do is to focus on the user. The goal with this stage is to understand the user’s needs, wants, and hates.
            <br>
            What motivates them? What workarounds do they have daily? You want to gather a lot of knowledge about how users live their lives, and how you can help them enjoy life even more.
            <br>
            This is where some knowledge of psychology comes in real handy. Some companies reach out to experts in human behavior while other, smaller companies, simply settle for observing and trying to see things from the POV of the user.
            <br>
            You can achieve this by engaging with users – you can hold interviews, but try to make them casual and resemble more a conversation than a formal interview.
            </p>
            <h1>2.Define</h1>
            <p>
              This stage in the design thinking process takes aim at the real problem your design will set out to solve. Now is the time to take everything you know about the user and identify the problems, the potential to make user’s lives better.
            <br>
            You want to define the issue based on your user research, without losing sight of the human side of your product. Ideally, you would define the problem in question in a problem statement. Don’t make your company the center of it – remember to keep the user in the spotlight at all times. As opposed to making your statement “we need to…” aim for “users need….”.
            </p>
            <h1>3.Ideation</h1>
            <P>
              This is the part of the design thinking process most designers love: dreaming up possible solutions! At this point, you’ve done your research and have a clear understanding of who the product is for, what it’s meant to do for its users and why that matters to the users. Now, you and your team can start dreaming up ways that your design could check all the right boxes.
            <br>
            You’ll use your problem statement as a starting point and build from there. There are a wide variety of techniques for idea generation out there – most design thinking processes include brainstorming or the worst possible idea so people can get creative about their solutions.
            </P>
            <h1>4.Prototype</h1>
            <p>
              This is the part of the design thinking process most designers love: dreaming up possible solutions! At this point, you’ve done your research and have a clear understanding of who the product is for, what it’s meant to do for its users and why that matters to the users. Now, you and your team can start dreaming up ways that your design could check all the right boxes.

            You’ll use your problem statement as a starting point and build from there. There are a wide variety of techniques for idea generation out there – most design thinking processes include brainstorming or the worst possible idea so people can get creative about their solutions.
            </p>
              
              <h1>5.Test</h1>
              <p>As you would expect from a model that has been around for a long time, the design thinking process varies according to industry, sector or just plain preference. Sometimes, you’ll find that testing is added to the prototyping stage.
            <br>
                We here at Justinmind don’t recommend throwing both prototyping and testing into the same step – mainly because testing can require quite a lot of planning and preparation in its own right.
                <br>
                The Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford had some great advice for designers: prototype as if you know you’re right, test as if you knew you were wrong. Testing your prototype isn’t just about telling users to do tasks or asking yes or no questions. It requires planning and some level of expertise if you hope to get reliable feedback from users.</p>
